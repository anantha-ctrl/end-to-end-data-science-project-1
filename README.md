# 🏠 House Price Predictor

A full end-to-end **Data Science project** that predicts house prices based on demographic and geographic features using the **California Housing dataset**. The model is trained with **scikit-learn** and deployed using **Flask** as a simple web app.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🔢 Predicts median house price in California (in $100,000s)
- 📊 Trained using Random Forest Regressor
- 🧼 Includes preprocessing, model training, evaluation
- 🌐 Deployed as a Flask web app
- 💾 Uses joblib to persist trained model
- 🎨 Simple HTML/CSS frontend
